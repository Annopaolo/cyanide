* Bson.Regex is obsolete and replaced with Regex
* Improved error messages
* Keys of maps are strings when decoded, by default
* encoder prototcol does not fallback to any to allow custom implementation
* removed encoding / decoding of the triplet tuple representing a time stamp (need to implement locally if needed)
* UTC is implemented using struct `Bson.UTC`
* in `Bson.Bin`, subtypes are positif integer (<256) not a binary anymore
* all atom representing constant like :min_key are in small caps (used to be MIN_KEY)
