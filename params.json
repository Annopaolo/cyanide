It is a data type with a standard binary representation defined at <http://www.bsonspec.org>.\r\n\r\nThis implements version 1.0 of that spec.\r\n\r\nThis project is used by [elixir-mongo](https://github.com/checkiz/elixir-mongo), a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) driver in Elixir.\r\n\r\nThis implementation maps the Bson grammar with Elixir terms in the following way:\r\n  - document: Keyword List\r\n  - int32 and int64: Integer\r\n  - double: Float\r\n  - string: String\r\n  - Array: List (non-keyword)\r\n  - binary: Bson.Bin (record)\r\n  - ObjectId: Bson.ObjectId (record)\r\n  - Boolean: true or false (Atom)\r\n  - UTC datetime: triple Atom\r\n  - Null value: nil (Atom)\r\n  - Regular expression: Bson.Regex (record)\r\n  - JavaScript: Bson.JS (record)\r\n  - Timestamp: Bson.Timestamp (record)\r\n  - Min and Max key: MIN_KEY or MAX_KEY (Atom)\r\n\r\nThis is how to encode a sample Elixir Keyword into a Bson Documentation:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nbson = Bson.encode a: 1, b: \"2\", c: [1,2,3], d: [d1: 10, d2: 11]\r\n```\r\nIn this case, `bson` would be a document with 4 elements (an Integer, a String, an Array and an embeded document)\r\n\r\nConversly, to decode a bson document:\r\n```elixir\r\n[a: 1] == Bson.decode <<12, 0, 0, 0, 16, 97, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecial Bson element that do not have obvious corresponding type in Elixir are represented with Record, for example:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\njsbson = Bson.encode js: Bson.JS.new code:\"function(a) return a+b;\", scope: [b: 2]\r\nrebson = Bson.encode re: Bson.Regex.new pattern: \"\\d*\", opts: \"g\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nImplementation of encoders and decoders is done using `Protocol`, so, it is possible to redefine them (for instance, encoding end decoding of Bson.Bin could be redefined for the userdefined subtype)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
